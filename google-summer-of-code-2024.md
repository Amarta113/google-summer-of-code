## Project Ideas

This is the GSoC 2024 project ideas list for Rocket.Chat.  As we continue to engage community mentors for 2024, the project ideas are subject to rapid changes.   (currently placeholders ideas from GSoC 2023 season)

### Whiteboard Integration

**Mentor(s):** Shiqi Mei, Douglas Gubert

**Description:**

White boards and visual drawing/concepts sharing has become a stable of team collaboration. Rocket.Chat currently does not offer any whiteboarding feature. [Markboard ](https://github.com/markboard-io/markboard)is an open source incumbent whiteboard created upon the same technology stack as Rocket.Chat and built by a team led by a Rocket.Chat GSoC alumni. This project will create a Rocket.Chat App that integrates Markboard into Rocket.Chat and extends its team collaboration features through Rocket.Chat.

**Desired Skills:** Advanced Typescript. MeteorJS. Rocket.Chat Apps development.

**Goals/Deliverables:** Rocket.Chat App integrating Markboard into Rocket.Chat. The App should extend team collaboration capabilities of Markboard in conjunction with our Team Channels feature.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)

**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Guided RC Code Walkthrough and Tutorial

**Mentor(s):** Kevin Aleman

**Description:**\
Most Rocket.Chat developers uses VSCode when studying our massive production code base, and when writing new code. VSCode is the best environment for conducting interactive tutorial and code walkthroughs. The CodeTour extension available in VSCode can be used to create such walkthrough and tutorials. This project involves the development of a set of guided tutorials using CodeTour that will help new developers to understand how to perform multiple actions. Paths to be documented will go from this areas:

* How a message is sent
* How to create an endpoint
* How to add a new service
* How to create a DB model
* How to use DB models
* How services interact between them
* How to build a lib
* How to navigate monorepo (where is everything, how's imported, etc)

We welcome any additional ideas you may have.

**Desired Skills:** NodeJS, MongoDB

**Goals/Deliverables:** A set of guided tours from the topics described above

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

**Difficulty:** Easy/Medium

### Flutter SDK for Rocket.Chat

**Mentors:** Sing Li, Debdut Chakraborty

**Description:**\
In recent years, [Flutter ](https://flutter.dev/)has became the de-facto standard for high performance open source multi-platforms apps development. Thanks to its[ huge global developers community](https://flutter.dev/community) and the ever-growing ecosystem of [open source flutter components](https://pub.dev/packages).

This project aims to create an easy to integrate flutter component to embed Rocket.Chat into any existing and new flutter applications (similar to our existing [EmbeddedChat](https://github.com/RocketChat/EmbeddedChat) project). In addition, a layer of Dart friendly API/stub needs to be created for application that needs in-depth modification of chat behavior or needing to use the chat engine as a messaging fabric.\
\
We invite and welcome original proposals at varying level.

**Desired Skills:**

Flutter, Flutter components construction, Dart, JavaScript. A thorough understanding of how Rocket.Chat core works. Knowledge of Flutter multi-platform development (Android, iOS, Linux, Windows and MacOS).

**Goals/Deliverables:**\
An SDK that enable easy embedding of RC instances into any flutter app plus Dart APIs to access RC collaboration engine internals.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours (Large)\
